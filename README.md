# Kernelized Sorting for Heterogeneous Data Alignment

## Overview
This project focuses on aligning heterogeneous data using the **Kernelized Sorting** method, a powerful approach for aligning sets of elements by comparing their distributions. I have developed an implementation of this method with an intuitive visualization interface. 

## Key Features
- Implementation of Kernelized Sorting for data alignment.
- Utilization of both Gaussian and kernel product-based kernels to measure similarity.
- Fine-tuning of the **sigma** parameter for appropriate similarity values in the similarity matrix.
- Application of the **Hungarian algorithm** for solving the linear assignment problem and finding the optimal permutation for data alignment.

## Results
I applied this method to a dataset containing 128 images representing the word **'AMU'** and observed satisfactory results. Similar images were effectively grouped together in close proximity on the grid.

## How to Use
You can find the implementation and the visualization interface in the project files (Kernelise and Calcul_Pi).
